_the light lab showed quantum nature of light as different colours of light require different voltages_

## Thin Film

when light contacts a thin clear film, some of the light will be refracted and some will be refracted. Some of that refracted light will hit the second boundary and will reflect back out.

$air \rightarrow n = 1$

$bubble \rightarrow n > 1$

when light reflects off a slow medium from a fast medium, it will invert. $\therefore$ the light that is bouncing off the top layer will be $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$ out of phase from the light passing through the bottom medium.

Thus in order to cause constructive interference, the light passing through must pass total a $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$, so the width of the medium must be $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$. Some with destructive. In order for the light to totally delete itself, the light must maintain it's $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$ wavelength phase shift, so the width of the medium must be $\lambda$

this all changes if the medium on the inside of the bubble is slower than the medium the bubble is made of, as in this means there would be a double reflection.

**Example** Find the min thickness of a bubble ($n = 1.4$) that can produce a maximum brightness for 540 nm light in air.

_for bubble min thickness for constructive is found at $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$_

find $\lambda$ in the bubble

$$\dfrac{n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}$$
$$\lambda_2 = \dfrac{\lambda_1 n_1}{n_2}$$
$$ = 3.857.71 nm$$
find thickness

$$ t = \dfrac{\lambda_2}{4}$$
$$ ...$$

whats the angle to the 3rd maxima for a single slit diffraction pattern where the screen is 2.7 m from a 0.14 mm slit that has 350 nm light waves passing through it.

$L = 2.7$

$W = 0.15 \times 10^-3 m$

$\lambda = 350 \times 10^-9m$

$m = 3$

$$ wsin\theta = (m + 0.5)\lambda$$
$$ theta = \sin^{-1}(\dfrac{(m + 0.5)\lambda}{w}) $$
$$ 0.47^o = \theta$$
