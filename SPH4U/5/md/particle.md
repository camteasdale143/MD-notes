# Particle Physics

matter is made up of 17 fundamental particles

these particles are categorized based on their properties

in the standard model there are hadrons and leptons

- Hadrons are made of quarks
  - Mesons have 2 quarks
  - Baryons have 3 quarks
- Leptons interact with the weak nuclear force ,
- gauge bosons - force carriers

![standard model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg/300px-Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg.png)

particles separated by three key properties

- spin - denotes intrinsic angular momentum of the particle
- charge - electrical charge
- strangeness - describes the decay of particles in strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces

all particles have antiparticles

antiparticles have all the same properties as their normal matter pair but have the opposite charge and strangeness

_the light lab showed quantum nature of light as different colours of light require different voltages_

## Thin Film

when light contacts a thin clear film, some of the light will be refracted and some will be refracted. Some of that refracted light will hit the second boundary and will reflect back out.

$air \rightarrow n = 1$

$bubble \rightarrow n > 1$

when light reflects off a slow medium from a fast medium, it will invert. $\therefore$ the light that is bouncing off the top layer will be $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$ out of phase from the light passing through the bottom medium.

Thus in order to cause constructive interference, the light passing through must pass total a $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$, so the width of the medium must be $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$. Some with destructive. In order for the light to totally delete itself, the light must maintain it's $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$ wavelength phase shift, so the width of the medium must be $\lambda$

this all changes if the medium on the inside of the bubble is slower than the medium the bubble is made of, as in this means there would be a double reflection.

**Example** Find the min thickness of a bubble ($n = 1.4$) that can produce a maximum brightness for 540 nm light in air.

_for bubble min thickness for constructive is found at $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$_

find $\lambda$ in the bubble

$$\dfrac{n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}$$
$$\lambda_2 = \dfrac{\lambda_1 n_1}{n_2}$$
$$ = 3.857.71 nm$$
find thickness

$$ t = \dfrac{\lambda_2}{4}$$
$$ ...$$

whats the angle to the 3rd maxima for a single slit diffraction pattern where the screen is 2.7 m from a 0.14 mm slit that has 350 nm light waves passing through it.

$L = 2.7$

$W = 0.15 \times 10^-3 m$

$\lambda = 350 \times 10^-9m$

$m = 3$

$$ wsin\theta = (m + 0.5)\lambda$$
$$ theta = \sin^{-1}(\dfrac{(m + 0.5)\lambda}{w}) $$
$$ 0.47^o = \theta$$
