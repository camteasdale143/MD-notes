# Review Questions
Just a couple questions to help me study for the upcoming quiz

### Scattering
- how is light traveling through the air polarized?
- why is the polarization of light being scattered only partial?
- why is the maximum polarziation of light occuring perpindicular to the light's original direction


### Quantum
- What 2 pieces of information are needed to know the kinetic energy of an electron ejected from a piece of metal?
    - _1. the amount of energy in a given photon of light 2. the work funciton of the material - how much energy it takes to eject an electron._
    - what is the kinetic energy of an electron released from a copper plate hit with 275 nm light
- does light have momentum?
- what is the formula for the amount of momentum a photon has?
- what is the energy and momentum of each photon that a 375 nm laser emits?
- how does weins law help dispell the idea of the uv catastrophy?
