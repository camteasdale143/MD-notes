# Collisions

#### Elastic Collisions

Collisions in which objects collide and bounce off of each other, kinetic energy and momentum are conserved

#### Inelastic Collisions

Collisions in which objects collide and don't bounce of each other such that momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is **not** conserved

in perfect collisions we can sub into our momentum and kinetic energy conservation formula then solve a system of equations

$$\vec{p}_i = \vec{p}_f$$
$${E_k}_i = {E_k}_f$$

in inelastic collisions objects stick together so we only have the conservation of momentum equation to work with, but it's easier

$$m_1\vec{v_1}_i + m_2\vec{v_2}_i = m_t\vec{v_f}$$

ballistics pendulums are used to determine the speed of a projectile by knowing the height of a projectile in a pendulum, GPE $\rightarrow$ Ke then solving for final velocity of the system, then subbing into the equation of inelastic collisions outlined above

## 2D collisions

Not much of a note here but a couple tips can be provided

the law of conservation of momentum can be used in these situations, although often the momentum has to be broken into it's components.

$$ P_i = P_f $$
$$ m_1v_1{_i} + m_2v_2{_i}= m_1{v_1}_f + m_2{v_2}_f$$
$$ 4 kg(5.0m/s) + 1kg(0m/s)= 4kg(3.0m/s[right\space20^o up] + m_2{v_2}_f$$
$$20kgm/s = 12kgm/s[right\space20^o up] + m_2v_2{_f}$$

calculate for right component

$$20 kgm/s[right] = cos20^o 12kgm/s + p_2{_f}[right]$$
$$ 8.72kgm/s = p_2{_f}[right]$$
calculate fro up component

$$0kgm/s =\sin20^o 12kgm/s + p_2{_f}[up]$$
$$-4.1 kgm/s = p_2{_f}[up]$$\

momentum magnitude

$$ \sqrt{p_2{_f}[right]^2 + p_2{_f}[up]^2} $$

direction =

$$\theta = tan^{-1}(\dfrac{p_2{_f}[right]}{p_2{_f}[up]})$$
