# Springs

## Spring Force

springs linearly store energy and force in their coils. Each spring has a spring constant (k) that is determined experimentally. This constant will remain true and keep force in -> force out linear as long as the spring doesn't lose it's form.

Force is based on the spring constant and the distance the spring is pulled or pushed

$F_s = -k\triangle x$

## Spring Energy

spring energy (elastic potential energy) is teh amount of energy within a deformed spring

$E_e = \dfrac{1}{2}k(\triangle x)^2$

## Simple Harmonic Motion

in a spring, a weight will oscillate up and down, it's oscillation period can be modeled by the formula

$T=2\pi\sqrt\dfrac{m}{k}$
