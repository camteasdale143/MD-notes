# Fields

April 15 2018

A region where each point of that region experiences a force.

in classical physics all objects with mass are attracted to other objects that have mass

attraction force is the distance between the centers of the objects

$$ F_g = G\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$

additionally field strength can be determined based on radius

$$g=G\dfrac{m_2}{r^2}$$
