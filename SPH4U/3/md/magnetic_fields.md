# Magnetic Fields

### Permanent magnet

when the fields of the particles making an object up are aligned resulting in a significant magnetic field

Magnets create magnetic fields represented by $B$

can be visualized by drawing north to south or by using materials that are sensitive to magnet fields like iron.

earth has a pretty insane magnetic field

## Electromagnetism

moving electric current produces a magnetic field.
the direction of the field is determined with the right hand rule
_Fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field, thumb points towards the direction of the conventional current_

#### Field Strength

$$1T = 1\dfrac{kg}{C\times s}$$
Strength of magnetic field is measured in Tesla's

Magnetic force can be calculated by knowing the charge of a particle, it's velocity , magnetic field strength and the angle between the path of the particle and the magnetic field

$$ F_m = qvBsin\theta$$

### Magnetic force and current

electric current passing through a wire is made of a series of charged particles, so a wire placed in an electric field wil experience a magnetic force.

$$ F_{m (on \space wire)} = ILBsin\theta$$
where I is current, L is length of wire, B is the magnetic field, and theta is the angle between the wire and the electric field
