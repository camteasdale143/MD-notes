# Applications of Electric Fields

Electrostatic precipitators remove tiny particls from the emissions of processing and power plants that burn fossil fuels by ionizing the dirty air with a large current passing through a wire. At which point the ionized air is passed by a positively charged electric plate which pulls the ionized pollutants out of the air.

Sharks can sense weak electric fields of it's prey to find and eat it
