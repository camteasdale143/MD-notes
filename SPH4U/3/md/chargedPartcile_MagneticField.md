# Charged Particle in a magnetic Field

When a charged particle interacts with a magnetic field, it experiences a magnetic force, This force results in the path of the charged particle being bent into a circular path

$$r = \dfrac{mv}{qB}$$

_Make sure to regularly review formula sheet to remember quantities and units associated with those_

opposite charges will feel opposite forces, a proton and electron in the same field will go in opposite directions.

_x means into board, $\cdot$ means out of the board_
