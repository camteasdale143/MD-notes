# Waves

may 7 2018

light is an electromagnetic wave

- waves have - wavelength $\lambda$ distance between crests
- amplitude $a$
- velocity $v$

$$ v = f \lambda $$
describes the relationship between frequency of a wave and it's wavelength, to it's velocity.

## Reflection

For a reflection of a flat surface, the angle of incidence $\theta_i$, is always equal to the angle of reflection $\theta_r$.

The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal speed limit, when light moves from one medium to another, light's speed will change, although each individual 'particle' always goes the same speed,

There is a bend at the change of material, called refraction

### the index of refraction

the index of refraction $n$ is based on the ratio of $c$ to the velocity of light in a medium

$$ n = \dfrac{c}{v}$$

_index of refraction is determined experimentally_

Index of refraction is unitless, and must always be greater than one,

### Snells law

$$ n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$
the ratio of the index of refractions multiplied by the angle of incidence is equal to the ratio of the index of refraction times the angle of refraction

## The Spectrum

visible light contains many rays of light with different wavelengths, where each wavelength corresponds to a different color higher frequency

### Prisms

Even though light travels at the same speed through a vacuum, different wavelengths have different indexes of refraction when traveling through different media, blue light refracts the most, red light refracts the least, resulting in rainbows

### Critical angle

is the smallest angel of incidence at which a light ray can be totally reflected from the boundary between the two

$$\sin \theta_{critical} = \dfrac{n_2}{n_1}$$
