# Single Slit Defraction

Huygens principle, each point on a wave front can be considered as a point source of tiny secondary wavelets that spread out in front of the wave at the same speed as the wave itself

there is a very bright double region and the surrounding regions are of decreasing size and intensity

**Be able to draw single slit experiment**

$a$ or $w$= width fo the slit

$T$ or $\theta$= angle from the center of the screen

**Draw the wave nature of the lines**

- everything is measured from the middle (a/2)

- when $\dfrac{a}{2}sinT = \dfrac{lambda}{2}$ the waves are out of phase by $\pi$
- thus the waves cancel each other out forming a minima

we can develop a formula for minima

$$\dfrac{W}{2}sin\theta = n\dfrac{lambda}{2}$$

$$a\sin T = n \lambda$$

$$ \sin T = n\dfrac{\lambda}{a}$$

### ... missed formulas

since we know that the width h of the minima will be

$$\sin T = n\dfrac{\lambda}{a}$$

since T is a small angle $sinT \approx tanT$

$$ \dfrac{y}{L} = \dfrac{\lambda}{a} $$
