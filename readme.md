# Markdown PDF Note Taking script

This set of bash scripts / folder structure is the way that I take notes in school. by running the `new class` script a new class is created. Within that new class, new units can be made. Within those units are markdown and pdf folders.

All notes are written in markdown in the markdown folder. Then when they are ready to be converted to pdf the `update` script can be run to convert the markdown files. This of course requires pandoc to do.


More than anything else I am using github to save my work to the cloud.
