# Test Emulation

define areas of incerease, decrease, concavity based on $f(x)$
define areas of incerease, decrease, concavity based on $f\prime(x)$

given $f\prime(x)$ determine the shape of critical points

- sketch a rational
- sketch an irrational

determine asymptotes when given a function of the form $\dfrac{x^3...}{x^2...}$

use the second derivative test
determine the inflection points of a second derivative

do the abc test thing

draw a graph given information about zeros, where critical points are / aren't, where the graph is increasing / decreasing, concavity...
