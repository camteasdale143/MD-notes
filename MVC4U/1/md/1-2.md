# 1.2 Calculating Tangents

the IROC at x= is the slope of the tangent line

$$ \lim_{x \to 2} \dfrac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}  $$

determine the slope of tangent lines at a given point of a function

- solve for the slope of a tangent line at a given point of a simple ploynomial function

- solve for the slope of a rational fuction

- solve for the slope of a irrational fuction

- slove for the line of a function
