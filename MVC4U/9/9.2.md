# 1.3 Rates of change

Average rate of change in y with respect to x over teh interval from x=a to x=a+h is the slope of the secant] with endpoints $(a,f(a))$ and $(a+h, f(a+h))$

instant rate of change with respect ox at x/a is the slope of the tangent at the point $(a, f(a))$

$$lim_{h\rightarrow0} = \dfrac{f(a) - f(a + h)}{h}$$

must be able to do with

- polynomial functions
- rational
- radical functions (multiply by the conjugate)

**remember rates at the end of IROC / AVROC questions**
