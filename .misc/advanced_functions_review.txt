Unit 1

POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
- d = an!
    - where d is the common n'th degree differences, a is the leading coefficient, and n is the degree of the function
- subbing in -x in order to check if a function is even or odd
- AVROC and IROC in order to get rates of change
- use direction of AVROC / IROC to determine the direction of the function, (i.e. fish going up or down)

RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
- speed bump = unfactorable bottom
- oblique = divisible bottom
- horizontal asymptote is highest bottom term coefficient dividing top coefficient of same degree 
- Work solving equations and inequalities (especially expanding and solving)
- inequalities solution format
