## Unit 1 Matter
### 1. Modern Atomic Theory
- energy levels are composed of discrete regions called subshells
- subshells have regions called orbitals
- electrons spin in opposite directions in orbitals

##### MAT
- *n* principle quantum number
	- used to represent energy levelns
- *l* secondary quantum number
	- used to represent sublevels or subshells
	- 0 is sharp, 1 is principle, 2 is diffuse, 3 is fundemental
- *m_l* the orientation of orbitals in 3d space
	- range from -l to l
- *m_s* the direction an electron is spinning
	- -1/2 or 1/2


##### Principles
- *aufbau principle - fill orbitals of lowest energy first
- *Pauli exclusion Principle* - only two electrons can occupy any given orbital and must be of opposition spin
-  *Hund's Rule of Max multiplicity* - most stable arrangement of electronss is where the max # of unpaired electrons are apart
- *degenaret orbitals* electrons have the same chance of occuping any orbital of the same energy level and subshell



##### Electron Configurations


HUNDS RULE
- YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER THIS
ILL UP EVERYTHING WITH 1 BEFORE YOU START TO FILL THEM UP WITH 2





### long answer Questions

- Nonpolar molecules only have london dispersion forces between their molecules in solid form. Explain why all nonpolar molecules do not have the same melting point. Use dioagrams to help explain your answer [6]
- Describe how Hund's rule was used in the creation of energy level diagrams [[2]
- predict and justify the most common ion of tin[2]
- USe your detailed understanding of MAT, VSEPR theory and intermolecular and intramolecular forecs to predict and justify the trend in melting points for the following compounds: CH_2F_2; Ni; BH_3; NH_3. [10]

- COMPARE THE PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT MOLECULES SUCH AS NETWORK SOLIDS, METALS, AND POLAR/NONPOLAR MOLECULES







## unit 2, Thermochemistry

### long answer questions
- create a t-chart to describe three critical differences between an exothermic reaction and an endothermic reaction.

### notes
- delta H: negative means exothermic, positive means endothermic
- convert properly between scientific notation to regular notation
- convert to kilojoules from joules
- the summation equation is just adding up all the moles of energy of reactants - the sum of the moles of energy of products
	- this can look like: ((1 mol a)(-80kj/mol) + (3 mol b)(10 kj/mol)) - ((4mol c)(300kj/mol) + (2mol d)(0.1jk/mol))
- halves can be used in the application of hesses law in order to make it work out

### Confusion
- the combustion of magnesium in air is very exothermic
> Mg_(s) + 2HCl_(aq) -> H_2 + MgCl_2(aq) 	deltaH=x
> MgO_(s) + 2HCl_(aq) -> H_2O_(g) + MgCl_(2(aq)) deltaH=y
if the given two reactions aund their heats of eraction were used to determine the ehat of combustion of magnesium the result would be 
A. x+y
B. x-y
C. 2x-y
D.  Not enough information
E. x-2y
