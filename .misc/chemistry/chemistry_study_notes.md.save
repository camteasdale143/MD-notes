## Unit 1 Matter
### 1. Modern Atomic Theory
- energy levels are composed of discrete regions called subshells
- subshells have regions called orbitals
- electrons spin in opposite directions in orbitals

##### MAT
- *n* principle quantum number
	- used to represent energy levelns
- *l* secondary quantum number
	- used to represent sublevels or subshells
	- 0 is sharp, 1 is principle, 2 is diffuse, 3 is fundemental
- *m_l* the orientation of orbitals in 3d space
	- range from -l to l
- *m_s* the direction an electron is spinning
	- -1/2 or 1/2


##### Principles
- *aufbau principle - fill orbitals of lowest energy first
- *Pauli exclusion Principle* - only two electrons can occupy any given orbital and must be of opposition spin
-  *Hund's Rule of Max multiplicity* - most stable arrangement of electronss is where the max # of unpaired electrons are apart
- *degenaret orbitals* electrons have the same chance of occuping any orbital of the same energy level and subshell



##### Electron Configurations
- electron orbital configurations can be written in
	- full 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2
	- condensed [Ar] 4s^1
