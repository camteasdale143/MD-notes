  - How characters will have multiple sides to themselves that _are shown at different points of their lives_
- The Technological good
  - Orxy and crake is centered around the idea of developing technology that is ultimately detrimental to society
  - Atwood argued that the technology would have never been developed if we were not more afraid of not having the technology than having it
    - this could be like how we are more afraid of getting old and losing our sex appeal than developing a way to regenerate our new skin
    - Could also be that crake is more afraid of the anguish of life than the peace of eternal sleep
