statement: Art is just the expression of the human condition, It is the expression of what is means to be human

support: I would argue that art is intrinsically different from the principles of design. While principles of design are naturally appealing to us, the straight edge, davcii's ratio, contrasting colour, art is a higherlevel thought than these simple design principles. Art requires some form of meaning on a human level, whereas design only has to appeal to our archaic likes and dislikes.
