# how to read more books

## Reading everyday

- read once a day everyday for 30 minutes a day
- to read faster you need to use your hand to guide your eyes so you can't sub-vocalize
- to increase comprehension you need to see and sense the things you are reading, you can't just read them. Smell them, taste them
- you must allow yourself to self reflect while you read, and you must give yourself time to read to self reflect
