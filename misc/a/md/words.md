# An Attempt at Self expression

_fearlessly express yourself_

a trite and well repeated saying that more peopel _should_ listen to, that many young people in particular don't seem to follow

but you can't fearlessly express yourself if you don't know what to express

the problem is that those who tell us to express ourselves have found themselves, and are unwilling or unable to change who they are.

`Every body in the town builds, and spends their life building. from little cozy cottages to abundant glaring barns, everybody creates the building they use to live their lives.`

`From the day the kids are born they are tought to build. Their parents take them from the womb and show them why their prefered foundation is the best. Not that there is truly any correct way to build every house, but there are groups of central tennets that tend to make people build their buildings closer to each other. People that build with wooden frames will generally teach their kids that wooden frames are the best and will live arround others that bulid with wooden frames.`

`The children grow up in their parents houses, watching them finish up the details of the bulding, the decorating, the cleaning, for these jobs are never truly finished. Perhaps every once in a while a child will see somebody elses house on the tv, or going to a friends house, but generally the kids don't get too much exposure to other building styles outside their community.`

`And then as they grow up more they start to leave their parent's house to live on their own, they start to build for themselves. Not to say they can't go home when they need, but they are expected to try and become independent. It's at this point they start to question what house will they will build, what do they want to build? But they don't know what they want to make, who would? It is in their natur eto experiment, but one can only experiment so much past their own understanding of the world.`

`And the kids build their houses in the undeveloped part of town together. People of different roots, different experiences. They all build different buildings together. People are there to guide, but they are biased by their own knowledge of foundadiotns, beam structure, insulation, decoration. These 'guides' often give advice impermieable to the kids, "don't forget to dust the rafters once a month" but this advice isn't helpful, especially for the kids who haven't even started to build their walls yet.`

`For the most part they build what they know, with some people building exactly what they don't know just to spit etheir parents. But nonetheless they all experiment and they try to find out how they fit into their building community. They find a subcommunity of people who they create co-advantageous buildings with. A shared interest their style.`

`critics of this system have suggested that this developing area is very derivative, that many of them look the same. All the kids just want t ofeel like they can build on their own, and all the kids want to build a house that fits into community.`

`One day one of the young girl visits her grandmothers house. In an established community, discusses her trouble with the way that her developments are going. She of course, fits into her developed community as millions of people have fit into these analagous learning lands before. Her grandmother of course thinks her buildings are simple, how dirivative, you need to express who you are to the world like I have. Look at me, I have found this community fo people with similar building ideals as myself, I know what my house looks like, and I know what most of my future houses will look like, and you should be like me. Build what you want to build, don't conform to be like everybody else in the leraning lands.`

`and so the girl takes this information and tries, but without an understanding of what to build, she fails to create a house she is comfortable with, and returns to her community with the others`

our elders, the wisest in society, have a clearly defined identity, and they tell the children to just be themselves, to not care what others think.

but we are not old enough to know who we are, so we try to
